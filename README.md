## Project Description
What makes a name timeless or trendy? In this project, I used data published by the U.S. Social Security Administration spanning over a hundred years to understand American baby name tastes.

The ranking, grouping, joining, ordering, and pattern matching skills I used in this project are broadly applicable: understanding changing tastes is a key competency for businesses as well as parents searching for a baby name!
